\usage{
make.spacemix.map.list(MCMC.output.file, geographic.locations, name.vector,
  color.vector, quantile = 0.95, burnin = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{MCMC.output.file}{This is the full path, given as a character argument 
    (i.e., in quotes), of the MCMC_output R object generated by a SpaceMix 
analysis.}

\item{geographic.locations}{This is a k x 2 matrix in which the ith row
gives the geographic coordinates (i.e., longitude and latitude) of 
the ith sample.}

\item{name.vector}{This is a character vector of length k in which each 
element gives the name of the corresponding sample.}

\item{color.vector}{This is a vector of colors of length k in which each element
gives the color in which the corresponding sample should be plotted.}

\item{quantile}{This value determines the size of the credible interval
    calculated for model parameters.  A value of 0.95 denotes the 95\% credible 
interval.}

\item{burnin}{This value determines how many sampled iterations of the MCMC to discard
as `burn-in.' A value of 200 means that the first 200 sampled iterations of the MCMC 
will be discarded when calculating credible intervals.}

\value{
This function returns a list that can be used for plotting and visualization
	of SpaceMix output.  The components of this list are:
\itemize{
\item MCMC.output - This is a list of the output of the SpaceMix analysis, 
		containing all the elements of the output .Robj file.
\item geographic.locations - This is a k x 2 matrix in which the ith row
	gives the geographic coordinates (i.e., longitude and latitude) of 
	the ith sample.
\item name.vector - This is a character vector of length k in which each 
	element gives the name of the corresponding sample.
\item color.vector - This is a vector of colors of length k in which each element
		gives the color in which the corresponding sample should be plotted.
\item quantile - This value determines the size of the credible interval
		calculated for model parameters.
\item best.iter - This is the index of the sampled MCMC iteration with the largest
	posterior probability.  We refer to parameter estimates in that iteration as
	the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates.
\item admix.source.color.vector - This is a vector of faded colors (the same as given
	in \code{color.vector}), for which the extent of fading is determined by the 
		admixture proportion.  These colors, for which the opacity is proportional
	to the estimated admixture proportion, are used in plotting the admixture 
	sources and admixture arrows.
\item k - This is the number of samples in the analysis.
\item MAPP.geogen.coords - This is the Procrustes-transformed MAP geogenetic location 
	coordinates.
\item MAPP.admix.source.coords - This is the Procrustes-transformed MAP admixture source 
	location coordinates.
\item procrustes.coord.posterior.lists - This is a list of the Procrustes-transformed 
	location parameter coordinates.
		\itemize{
			\item geogen.coords.list - A list of length N, where I is the number of sampled
				MCMC iterations.  The ith element of the list contains the Procrustes-
				transformed geogenetic location coordinates in the ith sampled iteration 
				of the MCMC.  As a whole, this list represents the posterior distribution 
				of geogenetic location parameters for all samples.
			\item admix.source.coords.list - A list of length N, where I is the number of sampled
				MCMC iterations.  The ith element of the list contains the Procrustes-
				transformed admixture source location coordinates in the ith sampled iteration 
				of the MCMC.  As a whole, this list represents the posterior distribution 
				of admixture source location parameters for all samples.
		}
\item pp.geogen.location.matrices - A list of length k in which the ith element is the Procrustes-
		transformed posterior distribution of geogenetic location coordinates for the ith sample.
\item pp.admix.source.location.matrices - A list of length k in which the ith element is the Procrustes-
		transformed posterior distribution of admixture source location coordinates for the ith sample.
\item pp.geogen.ellipses - A list of length k in which the ith element gives the boundaries of the 
		95\% credible ellipse of the Procrustes-transformed posterior distribution of geogenetic 
	location coordinates of the ith sample.
\item pp.admix.source.ellipses - A list of length k in which the ith element gives the boundaries of the 
		95\% credible ellipse of the Procrustes-transformed posterior distribution of admixture source  
	location coordinates of the ith sample.

a list object that can be used or reference later for easy visualization 
of SpaceMix results.
