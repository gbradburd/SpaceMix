\usage{
make.spacemix.map(spacemix.map.list, text = FALSE, ellipses = TRUE,
  source.option = TRUE, xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{spacemix.map.list}{This is the name of the list produced using the function 
\code{\link{make.spacemix.map.list}}.  This list should already be loaded into 
R's working memory.}

\item{text}{This option (\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}) specifies whether sample 
names should be printed on the plotted figure at the locations of the MAP 
parameter estimates for each sample's geogenetic location and that of its 
admixture source location.}

\item{ellipses}{This option (\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}) specifies whether 
bivariate credible interval ellipses should be plotted for sample geogenetic 
locations and admixture source locations.}

\item{source.option}{This option (\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}) specifies whether 
the sources of admixture for each sample will be plotted, with accompanying 
admixture arrows.}

\item{xlim}{This vector of length 2 gives the minimum and maximum x-value of the 
plotting window.  Default is NULL, in which case the \code{xlim} used will 
be the minimum and maximum credible ellipse x-coordinates.}

\item{ylim}{This vector of length 2 gives the minimum and maximum y-value of the 
plotting window. Default is NULL, in which case the \code{xlim} used will 
be the minimum and maximum credible ellipse y-coordinates.}
}
\value{
This function plots the output of a SpaceMix analysis.  If specified, 
	sample names are plotted at the MAP estimates of their geogenetic and admixture 
	source locations.  Ellipses with solid margins denote credible intervals on 
	the posterior distributions of sample geogenetic locations, while those with dashed 
	margins denote credible intervals on the posterior distributions of sample admixture 
	source locations. The \code{source.option} specifies whether admixture source 
	locations are drawn, as well as whether admixture arrows are drawn.  Admixture 
	arrows are drawn from a source of admixture to its target.  The opacity of the 
	admixture arrows (and credible ellipses on admixture source locations) is proportional 
	to the amount of admixture drawn (i.e., samples with more admixture have darker arrows 
		and ellipses). The return value of this function is invisible.

\description{
This function plots the output of a SpaceMix analysis. Users can specify
whether they wish to also visualize the names of the samples, the 
credible ellipses of estimated sample geogenetic and admixture source 
location coordinates, as well as whether they wish to visualize the 
sources of admixture at all.
