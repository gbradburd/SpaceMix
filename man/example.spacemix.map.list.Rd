\format{A list with 15 elements, 
	using \code{K} as the number of samples

\describe{
\item{MCMC.output}{
	This is a list of the output of the SpaceMix analysis, 
	containing all the elements of the output .Robj file.}
\item{geographic.locations}{
	This is a \code{K} x 2 matrix in which the ith row
	gives the geographic coordinates (i.e., longitude and  
	latitude) of the ith sample.}
\item{name.vector}{
	This is a character vector of length \code{K} in which each 
	element gives the name of the corresponding sample.}
\item{color.vector}{
	This is a vector of colors of length \code{K} 
	in which each element gives the color in which 
		the corresponding sample should be plotted.}
\item{quantile}{
	This value determines the size of the credible 
		interval calculated for model parameters.}
\item{best.iter}{
	This is the index of the sampled MCMC iteration with the largest
	posterior probability.  We refer to parameter estimates in that iteration as
	the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates.}
\item{admix.source.color.vector}{
	This is a vector of faded colors (the same as given
	in \code{color.vector}), for which the extent of fading is determined by the 
		admixture proportion.  These colors, for which the opacity is proportional
	to the estimated admixture proportion, are used in plotting the admixture 
	sources and admixture arrows.}
\item{k}{
	This is the number of samples in the analysis.}
\item{MAPP.geogen.coords}{
	This is the Procrustes-transformed MAP geogenetic location 
	coordinates.}
\item{MAPP.admix.source.coords}{
	This is the Procrustes-transformed MAP admixture source 
	location coordinates.}
\item{procrustes.coord.posterior.lists}{
 	This is a list of the Procrustes-transformed 
	location parameter coordinates.}
		\itemize{
			\item geogen.coords.list A list of length N, where I is the number of sampled
				MCMC iterations.  The ith element of the list contains the Procrustes-
				transformed geogenetic location coordinates in the ith sampled iteration 
				of the MCMC.  As a whole, this list represents the posterior distribution 
				of geogenetic location parameters for all samples.
			\item admix.source.coords.list A list of length N, where I is the number of sampled
				MCMC iterations.  The ith element of the list contains the Procrustes-
				transformed admixture source location coordinates in the ith sampled iteration 
				of the MCMC.  As a whole, this list represents the posterior distribution 
				of admixture source location parameters for all samples.

\item{pp.geogen.location.matrices}{
	A list of length \code{K} in which the ith element is the Procrustes-
		transformed posterior distribution of geogenetic location coordinates for the ith sample.}
\item{pp.admix.source.location.matrices}{
	A list of length \code{K} in which the ith element is the Procrustes-
		transformed posterior distribution of admixture source location coordinates for the ith sample.}
\item{pp.geogen.ellipses}{
	A list of length \code{K} in which the ith element gives the boundaries of the 
		95\% credible ellipse of the Procrustes-transformed posterior distribution of geogenetic 
	location coordinates of the ith sample.}
\item{pp.admix.source.ellipses}{
	A list of length \code{K} in which the ith element gives the boundaries of the 
		95\% credible ellipse of the Procrustes-transformed posterior distribution of admixture source  
	location coordinates of the ith sample.}
