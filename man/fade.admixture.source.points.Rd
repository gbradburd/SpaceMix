\title{Fades a sample's color}
\usage{
fade.admixture.source.points(pop.cols, admix.proportions)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop.cols}{This is a vector of colors of length k in which each element
gives the color in which the corresponding sample should be plotted.}

\item{admix.proportions}{This is a vector of length k in which each element
is the estimated admixture proportion in the corresponding sample.}
}
\value{
This function returns a vector of faded colors, for which the 
		extent of fading is determined by the admixture proportion.
}
\description{
This function fades a sample's color in proportion to its admixture proportion. 
A sample with a smaller admixture proportion is represented by a fainter color. 
When visualizing SpaceMix's output, it can be helpful to visualize the amount 
of admixture a sample is drawing by having samples that draw small amounts of 
admixture show up more faintly in figures.
}
\examples{

#generate example admixture proportions
 admix.values <- seq(0.5,0,length.out=100)
# make plotting colors
 admix.cols <- fade.admixture.source.points(rep("red",100),seq(1,0,length.out=100))
plot(admix.values,ylab="admix proportion",pch=19,col=admix.cols)
}
