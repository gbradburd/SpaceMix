Description: This package contains the scripts necessary to run SpaceMix, a statistical method for inferring and visualizing patterns of population genetic structure.  The output is a geogenetic map in which distances between samples reflect genetic, rather than geographic distance.  In addition, this method infers long-distance admixture events, and visualizes them as arrows, from the source of admixture to its target, on this geogenetic map.
